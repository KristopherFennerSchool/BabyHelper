# BabyHelper
App to track baby Feeding and changing to assist new parents into their hectic lifes.

The BabyHelper will allow new parents to quickly and easily keep track of their little ones needs. Using different activities and fragments we can quickly collect and save instance data for parents to allow them to share the updates between eachother.
Simply opening the app will allow you to see the last time a change was made such as most recent feeding.
Then selecting an option will allow you to add either a prefill from last feeding or a custom feeding incase the feeding happened earlier and the addition was missed.
This also acts as a log so that the parents can back track and review past feedings to ensure their baby is on a healthy pace.
There is not much else other than a few clicks of a button and you can easily track baby information.
