# BabyHelper
App to track baby Feeding and changing to assist new parents into their hectic lives.

The BabyHelper will allow new parents to quickly and easily keep track of their little ones needs. Using different activities and fragments we can quickly collect and save instance data for parents to allow them to share the updates between each other.
Simply opening the app will allow you to see the last time a change was made such as the most recent feeding.
Then selecting an option will allow you to add either a prefill from last feeding or a custom feeding in case the feeding happened earlier and the addition was missed.
This also acts as a log so that the parents can backtrack and review past feedings to ensure their baby is at a healthy pace.
There is not much else other than a few clicks of a button and you can easily track baby information.

# OUTLINE
The Problem Being Addressed
The Problem being approached with this app is that many parents with Children as old as 1 and as young as a newborn have to learn to integrate the baby's needs into their already busy schedules. When parents transition between caring for the baby it often becomes a trouble shooting fiasco to narrow down what the baby needs and when, such as feeding or diaper changes.
How we approach this Problem
The approach this app will take to address this problem is by taking those things that are important to track and giving them a simple location to quickly log and communicate. Parents will be able to log quickly bottle feedings and changings to keep track of the babyâ€™s current needs but also have an on the go log should the parent need to refer back to the information such as at doctors.
Our Platform
The idea is relatively simple, a calendar with Monthly, Weekly, and Daily tracking of baby feedings that will connect between both parents' phones to easily keep both parents in the loop of their child's care. The parents will be able to enter logs with a few simple clicks allowing the calendar to be updated and accurate feeding logs to be kept. The idea for the app will be a clean design to support the simplicity we hope to bring to parents' lives.
Seeing that we will base our ideology on simplicity it will be vital to have a responsive interface that is not overloaded with clutter, something straight to the point to support the parents.
We will have to have communication capabilities between the shared accounts, the information will need to be stored and communicated between multiple devices in order to meet the functionalities.
Design
As discussed on the basis of our platform simplicity will be key and that is something that will translate directly into the design of the app.
